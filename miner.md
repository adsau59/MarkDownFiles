# DefineX Miner

In end of 2017, a group was formed called DefineX Miner who were interested in investing in Cryptocurrency but didn't want to invest in it directly as it is very unstable, so they opt to GPU mine cryptocurrency instead.

Group Administrators:

- Adam Saudagar
- Shamuwel Ansari
- Alwaz Khan

### Finding investor
- Group Administrators started inviting friends and family to invest in the group for the capital for the miner.
- A total of 13 people were found which invested an equal amount to divide the shares of the miner equally.
- A ledger was created to keep tally of the capital, and keep track of where it was used.
